Description: FUSE-based file system backed by Amazon S3
 s3fs is a FUSE filesystem that allows you to mount an Amazon S3 bucket
 as a local filesystem. It stores files natively and transparently in
 S3 (i.e., you can use other programs to access the same files).
 Maximum file size=64GB (limited by s3fs, not Amazon).
 .
 s3fs is stable and is being used in a number of production environments,
 e.g., rsync backup to s3.
